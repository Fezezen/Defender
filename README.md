# Defender Clone (C)

This was a game I made for a college project in roughly 2 days (~12 hours of actual work)
Originally I was going to do this in Rust, but I don't know Rust well enough yet to do any games in it.
So I revisted C because I haven't written in just C for a couple years.

There was a lot of headaches around malloc (my own fault of course) because I'm too used to C++
