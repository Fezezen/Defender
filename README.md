# Defender Clone (C)

This was a game I made for a college project in roughly 2 days (~12 hours of actual work)
Originally I was going to do this in Rust, but I don't know Rust well enough yet to do any games in it.
So I revisted C because I haven't written in just C for a couple years.
There was a lot of headaches around malloc (my own fault of course) because I'm too used to C++

The game isn't really a complete version of Defender. The only enemy in the game is the lander, and all they do is pick up humanoids and drop them. There's no waves, instead the landers just spawn faster and faster and the objective is to keep at least 1 humanoid alive for the longest.
